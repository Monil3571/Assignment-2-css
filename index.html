        where, oh where can my baby be? <br />
        The Lord took her away from me <br />
        She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good <br />
        So I can see my baby when I leave this world <br />

        We were out on a date in my daddy's car <br />
        We hadn't driven very far... <br />
        There in the road, straight ahead <br />
        A car was stalled, the engine was dead <br />
        I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right <br />
        I'll never forget the sound that night <br />
        <span class="seriousLines">
          The painful scream that I heard last <br />
          The screaming tires, the busting glass <br />

        When I woke up, the rain was pouring down <br />
        There were people standing all around <br />
        Something warm running through my eyes <br />
        But somehow I found my baby that night <br />
        I lifted her head, she looked at me and said <br />
        <span class="sadLines">
          "Hold me, darling, just a little while" <br />
        </span>
        I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss <br />
        I found the love that I knew I would miss <br />
        But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight <br />
        <span class="death"> I lost my love, my life that night <br /> </span>
